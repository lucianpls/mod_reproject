# mod_reproject
# NOT YET FUNCTIONAL

An apache module that converts a geospatial tile service from one projection and tiling grid to another

Implements one apache configuration directive:
**Retile_ConfigurationFiles source_configuration_file configuration_file**
The first file contains the source raster information, while the second the desired configuration for the output 

# Directives for both configuration files

**Size X Y Z C**
  - Mandatory, at least x and y, the raster size in pixels, in both files

**PageSize X Y 1 C**
  - Optional, the pagesize in pixels, in both files

**Projection String**
  - Optional, in both files

**SkippedLevels N**
  - Optional, defaults to 0, counted from the top of the pyramid, in both files

**Projection WKT**
  - Optional, defaults to WM, as in WebMercator

**BoundingBox xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax**
  - Optional, bounding box, defaults to 0 to 1 in both x and y

# Directives only in the reproject configuration file

**SourcePath**
  - Mandatory, the location of the tile source, up to the numerical arguments, as a local web path suitable for a subrequest

**EmptyTile**
  - Size Offset FileName

**MimeType**
  - Output mime type, defaults to input format

**RegExp**
  - One or more, guard regular expression, the URL has to match one of these if any is present

**ETagSeed**
  - A base32 64bit number, to be used as a seed for ETag generation

**InputBufferSize**
  - Default is 1MB, should be larger than the maximum expected input tile size

**OutputBufferSize**
  - Default is 1MB, should be larger than the maximum expected output tile size

**Quality**
  - A floating point figure, format dependent.  Default is 75, suitable for JPEG format

**Oversample**
  - If on and the output resolution falls between two available input resolution levels, the lower resolution input will be chosen instead of the higher one. 

  # Ways to use

  If the input and output size and alignment match, it can be used to change quality.
